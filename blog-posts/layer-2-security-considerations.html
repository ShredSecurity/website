<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Layer 2 solutions offer scalability improvements but introduce unique security considerations that developers must address.</p>

<h2>Security Challenges</h2>
<p>L2 solutions introduce new attack vectors including bridge vulnerabilities, sequencer risks, and data availability concerns.</p>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<p>Implement proper validation mechanisms, design secure bridge contracts, and consider data availability guarantees when building on L2.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While L2 solutions provide scalability, security must remain a top priority throughout the development process.</p>
